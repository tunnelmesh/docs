excerpt: Every side project starts with a frustration. Ours started with a weekend of fighting WireGuard configs, broken NAT traversal, and the realisation that none of the existing tools did exactly what we needed.

# Why We Built TunnelMesh

<!-- TODO: Write this post -->
<!-- Tone: personal, honest, conversational. This is the "origin story" post. -->

## The problem we kept hitting

<!-- Describe the specific pain point — distributed homelab / cloud nodes, messy VPN configs, NAT hell, hub-and-spoke bottlenecks. What was the final straw? -->

## What we tried first

<!-- Brief tour of alternatives: WireGuard (loved the crypto, hated the manual config), Tailscale (great product, not self-hostable enough for our needs), ZeroTier (close but...). Be fair and specific. -->

## The "why not just build it" moment

<!-- The turning point. What made you decide to roll your own? What gave you confidence it was tractable? -->

## What we wanted it to feel like

<!-- The design goals stated as user experience, not technical specs. "I wanted to type one command and have two machines talking." -->

## Where we are now

<!-- Brief forward-looking note — the project exists, you're writing about it, link to the Introducing TunnelMesh post. -->
