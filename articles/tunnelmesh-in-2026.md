# New Year, New Mesh: Where TunnelMesh Is Going in 2026

<!-- TODO: Write this post -->
<!-- Tone: personal, reflective, forward-looking. This is the "state of the project" post. Be honest about rough edges. -->

## What shipped in the last two months

<!-- Quick recap of the major features since launch: Docker integration, NFS support, transport fallback improvements. Link to the relevant posts. -->

## What surprised us

<!-- Things you didn't expect: user feedback, unexpected use cases, performance results that differed from assumptions. Keep it genuine. -->

## What we're still not happy with

<!-- Honest admission of current pain points: install experience, coordinator HA, anything the docs don't cover well. -->

## The 2026 roadmap

<!-- What's coming. Suggested items (adjust to what's actually planned):
- Multi-coordinator federation
- Improved observability (per-flow metrics)
- Policy-as-code (GitOps for filter rules)
- Kubernetes CNI plugin
- Better Windows support
Be specific about what's near-term vs aspirational. -->

## How to follow along

<!-- GitHub repo, this blog, any community channels (Discord, mailing list, etc.). -->
