# 100 Nodes, 6 Countries: TunnelMesh in the Wild

<!-- TODO: Write this post -->
<!-- Tone: milestone celebration + honest operational lessons. Tell real stories (anonymised if needed). -->

## How we got here

<!-- Brief timeline from launch to this milestone. What drove adoption — organic? specific use cases? communities? -->

## The use cases we didn't expect

<!-- What are people actually using it for? Edge computing, homelab federation, remote access, CI/CD runners across cloud providers? Share the interesting ones. -->

## What held up well

<!-- Things that worked better than expected in production: performance, stability, specific features. Specific examples. -->

## What broke (and what we fixed)

<!-- Honest account of issues that emerged at scale: coordinator load, edge cases in NAT traversal, log volume, etc. What changes shipped as a result. -->

## Operational insights

<!-- Patterns from people running it in production: recommended coordinator sizing, monitoring setup, backup/HA strategies people devised. -->

## Thank you

<!-- Genuine appreciation for early users who reported issues, contributed docs, or just sent a note saying it worked. Name names if you have permission. -->
