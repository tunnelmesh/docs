## Article writing style
Articles should **not** read like documentation extensions. The docs cover the "what" and "how". Articles should cover the "why" and make things click for people who haven't read the docs yet.

- **Open with a relatable problem or question**, not a technical statement
- **Build a mental model first**: use an analogy or simple abstract before introducing jargon
- **Use ASCII diagrams** to illustrate architecture, flows, and state transitions
- **Friendly, informal voice**: write as if explaining to a smart friend who isn't a networking expert
- **Short paragraphs**: 2–3 sentences max
- **Introduce jargon gradually**: define it when first used, don't assume familiarity
- **End with a practical pointer**: a CLI command to try, a doc link, a next step

The target reader understands software but may not be a networking or cryptography expert.

## Language

Write in British English (UK). Use British spellings throughout prose, headings, and descriptions — e.g. `authorisation` not `authorization`, `behaviour` not `behavior`, `organise` not `organize`, `centre` not `center`, `colour` not `color`, `visualisation` not `visualization`, `enrolment` not `enrollment`, `dialogue` not `dialog`, `realise` not `realize`, `initialise` not `initialize`. Exception: do not change spellings that are part of technical standards (HTTP headers, protocol names, code identifiers, CLI flag output).

**No em dashes.** Em dashes (—) break reading flow and should not be used. Use a colon to introduce an explanation, a semicolon to join two related sentences, a comma for a light pause, parentheses for an aside, or a full stop to start a new sentence.
