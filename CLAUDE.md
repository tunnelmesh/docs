## Article writing style
Articles should **not** read like documentation extensions. The docs cover the "what" and "how". Articles should cover the "why" and make things click for people who haven't read the docs yet.

- **Open with a relatable problem or question**, not a technical statement
- **Build a mental model first** — use an analogy or simple abstract before introducing jargon
- **Use ASCII diagrams** to illustrate architecture, flows, and state transitions
- **Friendly, informal voice** — write as if explaining to a smart friend who isn't a networking expert
- **Short paragraphs** — 2–3 sentences max
- **Introduce jargon gradually** — define it when first used, don't assume familiarity
- **End with a practical pointer** — a CLI command to try, a doc link, a next step

The target reader understands software but may not be a networking or cryptography expert.
